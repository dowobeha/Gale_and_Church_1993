Ken, 

You may or may not remember me - I visited JHU as a Ph.D student for the first SCALE workshop, and we briefly interacted there (I was working with Chris Callison-Burch on the Joshua machine translation system). I’m now an assistant professor in the Linguistics Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Regardless, I wanted to let you know that I finally took the time to type up your code from the appendix of Gale & Church (1993) and put it up on github. I’m a big believer in open source software, and I’ve always admired that you put the code for the sentence aligner right there in the paper. I made a couple of very minor modifications to get the code to compile on a modern C compiler.

I know that numerous other implementations of your algorithm exist, but I thought that there should be a copy of your original code in electronic form for those who wish to use the original implementation. I hope that’s OK with you.
